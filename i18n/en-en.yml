    $Count: "\nCount in a full deck: "
    TraitSymbiosis      : Pair trait. The first $A is the "symbiont", and the second $A is its host. The symbiote is dependent on the host and cannot be attacked as long as there is a symbiosis between them. Also, the symbiote cannot receive $F in any way (other than fat tissue conversion) until the host is fed or the symbiotic bond is broken. $Count 4
    TraitCommunication  : Pair trait. When one $A receives $F - other $A immediatly receives $F too. Fat tissue conversation is not activating this trait. $CDRound.
    TraitCooperation    : Pair trait. When one $A receives $F from "food base", other $A takes $F out of turn. $CDRound.
    TraitCarnivorous    : $A can attack other unprotected $A. For the eaten animal receives $F$F. For biting off the tail gets $F. In case of failure don`t get any $F. Can not attack if fully fed. $EAT, $CDTurn.
    TraitParasite       : Can be deployed only on enemy $A. Increases the need for $F by +2. Can be dropped by $TraitTailLoss or $TraitRecombination. $Count 8
    TraitFatTissue      : Additional stock $F for $A, can be activated when animal is lacking $F. Can be placed multiple times on one animal. When activated transforms that tissue and more if needed. $A, that have food only in fat tissue is not counting as fed.

    TraitMimicry        : When $A is attacked, owner $A must redirect the attack. You can only redirect to $A, that can be attacked by this Carnivorous. If there is no such $A, then $TraitMimicry is not triggering. Loop Mimicry is possible only one time for attack. $Count 4
    TraitScavenger      : $A automatically receives $F when other $A is killed by Carnivorous. Only one $TraitScavenger receives $F in game, starting from $A of Carnivorous` owner clockwise direction. If there are many Scavengers, $F receives only one from non-fed from left to right. Can`t be used on $A with trait Carnivorous and vice versa. $Count 4
    TraitPiracy         : Once in a feeding phase player can grab one $F from other non-fed animal im game. Ignores any defensive traits. Can`t be used to fill fat tissue. $Count 4

    TraitPoisonous      : Carnivorous, ate this $A will die in the next extinction phase. $A, ate other poisoned animal without $TraintPoisonous will not die. $Count 4

      Attacker do not receive $F$F and can`t attack this turn.
      $A can`t hide in a shell, if attacked using Ambush, even if attack was redirected by Mimicry.

    TraitIntellect      : Carnivorous with this trait once in a turn can ignore one of the $A traits, that`s it going to attack. Can`t ignore Regeneration or Anglerfish. Swimming Carnivorous can`t attack any non-Swimming animals. $Count 4
    TraitAnglerfish     : Can be used only as $A. When Carnivorous is attacking your Anglerfish, it stops the game and attacking the attacker, ignoring one of the attacker`s traits. To work, Anglerfish also must to have none of the other traits, including pair traits. Enemies don`t see your Anglerfish, it is just an empty $A for them. Anglerfish can defend other empty $A  - for this you need to click it. $Count 4
    TraitTrematode      : Pair negative trait. Can be deployed on pair of $A$A of other player. Can`t be dropped by other cards. $Count 8
    TraitMetamorphose   : In your feeding phase insted of taking $F from  "food base" $A can drop off one of its traits (not leading to an increase in the need for food) and receive $F. Metamorphose can be used to quit Hybernation, Shell, Symbiosys. $Count 4
    TraitInkCloud       : Once in a feeding phase, when attacked, $A can release ink and will not be eaten. Carnivorous can attack that or others $A in next turn of feeding phase. $Count 4

    TraitFlight         : $A with this trait can`t be attacked with Carnivorous that have same or bigger amount of traits. $Count 6
    TraitThermosynthesis: $EAT, $CDTurn. Receive $F from the heat energy. Can`t use if there is another $A with this traint on this continent. $Count 6
    TraitPhotosynthesis : $EAT, $CDTurn. Receive $F from the sun energy. Can`t use if there is another $A with this traint on this continent. $Count 6
    TraitSpecialization : Pair trait. Link plant and $A so that it can get food only from this plant ignoring its traits.
    
    TraitAedificator    : In the beginning of the feeding phase "food base" receives extra 2 $F for every $A with this trait in this location. $Count 4
    TraitCnidocytes     : It does not prevent the death of the $A, but by the will of the player, it paralyzes the Carnivorous that attacked it, which until the beginning of the next turn ceases to have all traits, including paired ones. The effect of the Cnidocytes will take effect after the attack ends. $Count 4
    TraitNeoplasm       : Every feeding phase $A, with this trait, one of the traits ceases to act; when all traits are ceased, $A dies. Do not affect pair traits. $Count 4
    TraitRecombination  : >-
      $CDTurn. Pair trait. $A$A can exchange with themselves one of their non-pair traits.
      If impossible combinations appear on the animal as a result of recombination, the recombinated trait is dropped.
      Impossible combination on one animal:
      1. Two same traits (excluding Fat Tissue)
      2. Carnivorous and Scavenger
      3. Regeneration and any traits
      4. Regeneration and trait, leading to increased need of food.
      Recombinated filled Fat Tissue becomes unfilled.
      If after Recombination there are extra food on the animal, it destroys, but don`t fills Fat Tissue.
  
    TraitRegeneration   : $A can have only two traits, not leading to an increased need of food. If $A is killed, traits remain in game, but do not work. Before deploy phase caed od killed $A must be recovered from hand; If player don`t have any, recoveres from deck. Animal with this trait can be killed only by starvation. $Count 6

    TraitSuckerfish     : To be added...
    TraitHerding        : To be added....
    TraitMigration      : To be added.....

    TraitRstrategy      : Can be deployed on any animal in game. Player do not receive cards for $A with this trait. Instead in the beginning of the deploy phase, two cards are deployed as new $A of that player. $Count 6
    TraitHomeothermy    : $CDRound. $A with this trait can receive additional $F from "food base". Can`t be used to fill Fat Tissue. $Count 6
    TraitPlantHomeothermy: $CDRound. $A with this trait can receive additional $F from plant. Can`t be used to fill Fat Tissue.
    TraitShy            : If $A was attacked and survived, Carnivores cant attack this $A this phase. $Count 6
    
    PlantTraitRootVegetable: Only $A with trait $TraitBurrowing can receive $F from that plant.
    PlantTraitHoney: If your $A received $F from this plant, pick up a card from players with the most cards in hand.
    PlantTraitMycorrhiza: >-
      Pair trait.
      Two plants are linked with Mycorrhiza: all of them will survive, if any of them have $F left.
      After that at the end of the deploy phase every plant with no $F, will get $F.
    PlantTraitAquatic: Only $A with $TraitSwimming can receive $F from that plant.
    PlantTraitOfficinalis: >-
      $A, that received $F from plant with this trait, is counting as fed, but every of animal`s traits are ceased until the end of phase.
      Only Cover mark is working.
    PlantTraitProteinRich: $A, received $F from plant with this trait, additionally receives $F. $TraitCarnivorous can recieve food from that plant.
    PlantTraitTree: Only $A with traits $TraitMassive and/or $TraitFlight can receives food from plant with this trait. Gives Cover mark.
    PlantTraitParasiticPlant: >-
      Card Parasitic Plant is deployed on other plant.
      Rules for Parasitic Plant:
      1. Parasite is not counting in max plant amount on the game board.
      2. In feeding phase player can move $F from host-plant to parasitic plant instead of receiving food or using Carnivorous.
      Parasite survives, if it has got no food on it.
      Parasite dies if host-plant dies
    PlantTraitSpiky: Grants three Cover marks
    PlantTraitParasiticLink: Activate to move food on Parasite
    PlantTraitHiddenCarnivorous: Activate to attack $A

    TraitPlantGrazing: First, $A receives $F from plant. Then it can destroy other $F on this plant.
